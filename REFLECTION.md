# COMP 271 REFLECTION FOR ASSIGNMENT 1 & 2

## ASSIGNMENT 1; ADD METHOD


For the first assignment, I used a different name for my temporary array. I realize that it would have been simpiler to understand if I used temporary instead of "addtoArr". Besides that major difference, our codes look pretty similar and accomplish the same task of adding an index and adding a value to the end of the array. My comments were decent but could've gone into further detail

## ASSIGNMENT 2; REMOVE METHOD


For the second assignment, in the posted solution it was a lot more compact and simplier than how mine was. My code doesn't properly remove the element but instead singles out the smallest element and prints it again. I turned it into an object correctly and added the null component if there is nothing within the array. My comments explained what happened in the code but they could be explained a bit clearer in complete sentences instead of short phrases.
